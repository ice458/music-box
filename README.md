Electronic music box with PIC18F27Q43
This 4-channel electronic music box produces an attenuated sine wave and sounds like a mechanical music box.
DDS is implemented using waveform tables to reduce the computational load.  
This project was created using MPLAB X IDE v6.20, XC8 v2.46, and MCC v5.50.
